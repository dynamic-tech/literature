# Overview

This article starts off by clearly showing the steps you need to send and receive secret messages. These steps involve the use of `openssl`, so there's no need to rely on (or learn) S/MIME (encrypted emails).

# Generating your key-pair

To send and receive secret messages, you will need to create a *cipher key*. Since we'll be using **public-key cryptography** (aka **asymmetric cryptography**, explained soon in next subsection), the relevenat term here is *key-pair*. If you're confused, just hold on to the term **key**, for now.

The mathematics behind **public-key cryptography** is harder to explain as it involves *number theory* and [*modular arithmetic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic) (which takes a good part of a weekend to run through). It's much easier to consider how **symmetric keys** are risky to communicate to your collaborators *directly*, as we'll illustrate in the following.

## Why Public-key Cryptography?

We will be using [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), aka **asymmetric cryptography**, so that you won't have to be concerned with "*dessiminating your secret symmetric key*" to everyone you want to talk secretly with. That is, you won't ever have to "*meet your collaborators in dark alleys*" to agree on a **symmetric key**.

You can imagine such a **symmetric key** as having a one-to-one **substitution** dictionary. It would translate [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext) into [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext), like "*eagle*" into "*target*" and "*ruffled*" into "*arrived*", so your secret agents will know when "*the eagle is ruffled*". In its simplest form, it would possibly translate the alphabet '*A*' into '*B*', '*B*' into '*C*', and so on.

Historically, the transport/delivery of a **symmetric key** is the weakest link in cryptography. The person(s) transporting said key(s) can easily be intercepted. Phone lines can be tapped. Tom Cruise (Ã  la *Mision Impossible*) could wear a mask and appear exactly like your friendly university professor. The list of possible *key-loss scenarios* goes on.

# OpenSSL Reference

The man pages are consolidated [on OpenSSL's official site](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/).

## Which OpenSSL Implementation?

[LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org). Current version of this writing is `2.9.1`.

    openssl version

# Sending Encrypted Messages

Create a sample message:

    mkdir ~/temp
    cd ~/temp
    echo "Hello Yellow!" > data

## PEM Key Format

Use PEM key format. The format is Base64 encoded, for easy transport over text-based channels. In any case, you would eventually install your public-private key into your email system, which requires this key format.

**PEM** stands for **Privacy Enhanced Mail**.

Export your public and private key:

    openssl rsa -in id_rsa -outform pem > id_rsa.pem

    openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -outform pem > id_rsa.pub.pem

## Generate an Encryption Key

Do not use your recipient's *public key* to directly encrypt the message you send.

**Reduce Key-Use Profile.** Encrypting a lot of data (say 1 year's worth of voluminous messages) with said *public key* will present a bigger profile for hackers to crack that *public key*. Granted, you will normally salt all encryptions, but it's still best to provide as little material for dictionary attacks (and similar) as possible.

**Generate a random encryption key** for each message you send. Generate one now.

    openssl rand -base64 32 > data.key

## Encrypt the Encryption Key

Encrypt the *encryption key* with your *public key*. This simulates you encrypting a secret (the *encryption key*, in this case) *with your recipient's public key* to send to your recipient. You would normally encrypt with your recipient's *public key*.

    openssl rsautl -encrypt \
      -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin \
      -in data.key -out data.key.enc

**Default Input Key Type.** Of special note is the `-inkey <public-key.pem> -pubin` phrase. It indicates that the input key file is a public key. By default, [the command](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/rsautl.html) `openssl rsautl` expects the input key file to be a private key.

## Encrypt the Message

Now, we encrypt the secret message with our *encryption key*.

    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt \
      -in data -out data.enc \
      -pass file:./data.key

We will now refer to [the man page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/enc.html) for `openssl enc`.

**Cipher to Use.** As per the man page, the easiest and safest cipher to use is the [AES block cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) in [CFB mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Block_Chaining_(CBC)) using the longest key length of 256 bits.

**Salting** is required to prevent dictionary attacks.

**Password** is not needed; our argument to `-pass` is a file. We use the *encryption key* as "*password*", which is a lot more secure than a password that is humanly possible to type.

# Receiving Encrypted Messages

As per PKI, the recipient will use her private key for decryption.

## Decrypt the Encryption Key

Use the private key to decrypt the *encryption key*. Note that the *encryption key* is a *symmetric key*, so it acts as both an *encryption key* as well as a *decryption key*.

    openssl rsautl -decrypt \
      -inkey id_rsa.pem \
      -in data.key.enc -out received.key

## Decrypt the Message

Use the *encryption key* to decrypt the encrypted message.

    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc \
      -in data.enc -out received.data \
      -pass file:./received.key

TODO: Use "*known-plaintext attack*" to explain why we should not use the public key to encrypt secret messages.

TODO: Mention the Claude Shannon's "*confusion and diffusion*"? Will that require too much logic skills from readers?
